# Inhibitory rTMS and MI BCI

This study investigates the effects of inhibitory 1 Hz
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on motor im-
agery (MI) performance and brain-computer interface (BCI) de-
coding, using source-space electroencephalography (EEG) analy-
sis. We employed a two-day experimental protocol involving three
participants, combining MI tasks with EEG recording before
and after rTMS over the motor cortex. A Riemannian geometry-
based BCI decoding pipeline was used, incorporating adaptive
recentering for online unsupervised domain adaptation. Time-
frequency and source localization analyses revealed a spatial shift
in event-related desynchronization (ERD) from the contralateral
motor cortex to central motor areas following rTMS. Interest-
ingly, BCI decoding performance did not decline after rTMS, and
in some cases, showed slight improvement. This may be related
to changes in cortical activation patterns, though further study
is needed. These preliminary findings indicate that adaptive BCI
systems might be able to maintain performance even when brain
dynamics are altered, which could have implications for future
neurorehabilitation research.
